## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)  # For read_csv()
library(dplyr)  # For data manipulation

# Read the data
wine_data <- read.csv("winequality-white.csv")

# View the first few rows of the data
head(wine_data)

```
```{r}
# Linear Regression for combined dataset
lm_model <- lm(quality ~ alcohol, data = wine_data)

# Summary of the model
summary(lm_model)

```


```{r}
# Multiple Regression for combined dataset
multiple_lm <- lm(quality ~ alcohol + pH , data = wine_data)

# Summary of the model
summary(multiple_lm)

```
```{r}
# Create a binary outcome variable 
wine_data$high_quality <- ifelse(wine_data$quality > 5, 1, 0)
# Logistic Regression fr combined dataset
logistic_model <- glm(high_quality ~ alcohol + pH , 
                      family = binomial(), data = wine_data)
# Summary of the model
summary(logistic_model)
```
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Scatter plot for Linear Regression (quality vs. alcohol)
ggplot(wine_data, aes(x = alcohol, y = quality)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Linear Regression: Quality vs Alcohol", x = "Alcohol", y = "Quality")

# For multiple regression, you might select one predictor for visualization
# Scatter plot (quality vs. one of the predictors, e.g., pH)
ggplot(wine_data, aes(x = pH, y = quality)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Multiple Regression: Quality vs pH", x = "pH", y = "Quality")

```
```{r}
# Residuals vs Fitted for Linear Regression
ggplot(wine_data, aes(x = lm_model$fitted.values, y = lm_model$residuals)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Residuals vs Fitted for Linear Regression", x = "Fitted Values", y = "Residuals")

# Similarly for Multiple Regression

```
```{r}
library(pROC)

# Predicted probabilities
probabilities <- predict(logistic_model, type = "response")

# ROC curve
roc_curve <- roc(wine_data$high_quality, probabilities)
plot(roc_curve, main = "ROC Curve for Logistic Regression")

```
```{r}
library(caret)

# Predicted classes
predicted_classes <- ifelse(probabilities > 0.5, 1, 0)

# Confusion Matrix
confusionMatrix(factor(predicted_classes), factor(wine_data$high_quality))

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
